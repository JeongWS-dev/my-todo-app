## ✨ Part 1: React + TypeScript Environment Setup

> In Part 1, I set up the development environment using React, TypeScript, and Vite.  
> I also documented Node.js installation and ESLint/Prettier setup.

## 🧩 Part 2: Building the Todo UI with React + TypeScript

> In Part 2, I built the actual UI with reusable components, type safety, and custom styling.

### 📦 Features

- Add todos with `TodoInput`
- Display todos with `TodoList`
- Type-safe structure using a `Todo` interface
- Clean brown + beige themed UI (CSS)
- Fully responsive and globally accessible

### 🎨 Screenshots

## 💾 Part 3: Making My Todos Persistent (and Debugging React 18)

> In Part 3, I implemented localStorage-based persistence so that todos survive page reloads.  
> While doing so, I encountered an unexpected issue caused by React 18's Strict Mode—  
> and solved it by refining my useEffect logic.

### 🔍 Highlights

- Save todos in the browser using `localStorage`
- Load data automatically when the app starts
- Prevent unwanted overwrites in React 18’s development mode
- Improved reliability and user experience
